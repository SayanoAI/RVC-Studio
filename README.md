# RVC Studio
This project provides a comprehensive platform for training RVC models and generating AI voice covers. Use the app to download the required files before using or manually download them here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/SayanoAI/RVC-Studio/tree/main

## Features
* Youtube music downloader: download any music video from Youtube as an mp3 file with just one click.
* 1-click AI song covers: easily create AI song covers using RVC.
* RVC Model fine-tuning: fine-tune an RVC model to mimic any voice you want using your own data.
* 1-click TTS using RVC model: convert any text to speech using the fine-tuned VC model with just one click.
* Built-in tensorboard: You can monitor the training progress and performance of your VC model using a built-in tensorboard dashboard.
* LLM integration: chat with your RVC model in real time using popular LLMs.

## Planned Features
* Demucs: Meta's vocals and instrumental music source separation.
* Auto-Playlist: let your RVC model sing songs from your favourite playlist.
* Audio-postprocessing: You can enhance the quality of your generated songs by adding reverbs, echos, etc.
* TTS using cloud API: use a cloud-based text-to-speech service to generate high-quality and natural-sounding speech from any text.
~~* LLM integration: chat with your RVC model in real time.~~
* Real-time VC interface: convert your voice using your favourite RVC model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher (developed and tested on v3.8.17)
- Pip
- Virtualenv or conda package manager

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the zip file.
2. Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment with the command `virtualenv venv`.
3. Activate the virtual environment with the command `source venv/bin/activate` on Linux/Mac or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows. Or use `conda create -n RVC-Studio & conda activate RVC-Studio` if you're using conda package manager.
4. Install the required packages with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Run the streamlit app with the command `streamlit run Home.py`.

Or run it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SayanoAI/RVC-Studio/blob/master/RVC_Studio.ipynb)

## Instructions for inference
1. Download all the required models on the webui page or here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/SayanoAI/RVC-Studio/tree/main
2. Put your favourite songs in the ./songs folder
3. Press "Refresh Data" button
4. Select a song (only wav/flac/ogg/mp3 are supported for now)
5. Select a voice model (put your RVC v2 models in ./models/RVC/ and index file in ./models/RVC/.index/)
6. Choose a vocal extraction model (preprocessing model is optional)
7. Click "Save Options" and "1-Click VC" to get started

## Instructions for chat
Download one of the following LLM:
* [airoboros-7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Airoboros-L2-7B-2.1-GGUF/blob/main/airoboros-l2-7b-2.1.Q4_K_M.gguf)
* [pygmalion-7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Pygmalion-2-7B-GGUF/blob/main/pygmalion-2-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf)
* [zarablend-7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Zarablend-MX-L2-7B-GGUF/blob/main/zarablend-mx-l2-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf)

Feel free to use larger versions of these models if your computer can handle it. (you will have to build your own config)

## Dockerize
Run `docker compose up --build` in the main project folder.
**Known issue:** Tensorboard doesn't work inside a docker container. Feel free to submit a PR if you know a solution.

## FAQs
* Trouble with ffmpeg/espeak? [Read this](/dist/README.md)
